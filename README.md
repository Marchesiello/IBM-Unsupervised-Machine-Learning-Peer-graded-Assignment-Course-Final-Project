# IBM-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Peer-graded-Assignment-Course-Final-Project

One of the main objectives of this course is to help you gain hands-on experience in communicating insightful and impactful findings to stakeholders. In this project you will use the tools and techniques you learned throughout this course to develop a few clustering models or dimension reduction transformations on a data set that you feel passionate about. Then, you will select the algorithm that best suits your needs, and communicate insights you found from your clustering or dimension reduction exercise.

After going through some guided steps, you will have insights that either group similar observations together or explain a data set in a projection of less dimensions.

Alternatively, you can revisit a Supervised Learning (regression or classification) model and confirm whether it is best to have one model for your entire data set, or to have one model for each cluster of your data set.

As a main deliverable, you will submit a report that helps you focus on highlighting your analytical skills, thought process, and next steps.

# Grading Criteria Overview

Your peer or instructor will review your report from the perspective of a Chief Data Officer or the Head of Analytics of your team and will assess whether the Unsupervised Learning model you selected best helped you achieve the main objective of your analysis.

Yes, you are expected to leverage a wide variety of tools, but this report should focus on presenting findings, insights, and next steps. You may include some visuals from your code output, but this report is intended as a summary of your findings, not a code review. Optionally, you can submit your code as a python notebook or as a print out in the appendix of your document.

The grading will center around 5 main points:

Does the report include a section describing the data?

Does the report include a paragraph detailing the main objective(s) of this analysis?  

Does the report include a section with variations of Unsupervised Learning models and specifies which one is the model that best suits the main objective(s) of this analysis?

Does the report include a clear and well presented section with key findings related to the main objective(s) of the analysis?

Does the report highlight possible flaws in the model and a plan of action to revisit this analysis with additional data or different modeling techniques? 

# Step-by-Step Assignment Instructions

# Setup instructions:

Before you begin, you will need to choose a data set that you feel passionate about. You can brainstorm with your peers about great public data sets using the discussion board in this module.

Please also make sure that you can print your report into a pdf file.

# How to submit:

The format of your work must adhere to the following guidelines. The report should be submitted as a pdf. Optionally, you can include a python notebook with code.

Make sure to include mainly insights and findings on your report. There is no need to include code, unless you want to.

# Project

# Optional: find your own data set
As a suggested first step, spend some time finding a data set that you are really passionate about. This can be a data set similar to the data you have available at work or data you have always wanted to analyze. For some people this will be sports data sets, while some other folks prefer to focus on data from a datathon or data for good.

# Optional: participate in a discussion board

As an optional step, go into a discussion board and brainstorm with your peers great data sets to analyze. If you prefer to skip this step, feel free to use some of the data sets that were used throughout the course.

# Required
Once you have selected a data set, you will produce the deliverables listed below and submit them to one of your peers for review. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to produce analysis that are ready to highlight your analytical skills for a senior audience, for example, the Chief Data Officer, or the Head of Analytics at your company.

Sections required in your report:

Main objective of the analysis that also specifies whether your model will be focused on clustering or dimensionality reduction and the benefits that your analysis brings to the business or stakeholders of this data.

Brief description of the data set you chose, a summary of its attributes, and an outline of what you are trying to accomplish with this analysis.

Brief summary of data exploration and actions taken for data cleaning orfeature engineering.

Summary of training at least three variations of the unsupervised model you selected. For example, you can use different clustering techniques or different hyperparameters.

A paragraph explaining which of your Unsupervised Learning models you recommend as a final model that best fits your needs in terms.

Summary Key Findings and Insights, which walks your reader through the main findings of your modeling exercise.

Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data, which may include suggesting revisiting this model or adding specific data features to achieve a better model.
